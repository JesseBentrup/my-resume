# Jesse Bentrup | Operations & Sales Leader

**High-Impact Leadership | Process Optimization | Mentorship-Driven Growth**

I am a decisive and empathetic Operations Leader with over 20 years of experience transforming underperforming departments into high-efficiency engines. My career is defined by measurable revenue transformation—scaling an insurance agency to **$1.5M** and quadrupling a finance department's revenue to **$3M+**—and a commitment to the long-term development of people.

## 🚀 Key Value Proposition
* **The Multiplier Effect:** I specialize in identifying human bottlenecks and training staff into high-level managers. My "legacy" includes former direct reports who are now GMs and Sales Directors.
* **Operational Scale:** Certified in **Six Sigma Yellow Belt** and **Scrum Fundamentals**, I apply Lean methodologies to find hidden revenue and optimize CRM workflows (Salesforce, Zoho, LACRM).
* **Crisis Resilience:** Proven ability to maintain organizational stability and donor confidence during global economic shifts and transitions.
