# my-resume
I’ve built a $1.5M agency from scratch and led teams through COVID with empathy and common sense. Now a grandfather, my focus has shifted from the commission chase to stability and mentorship. I lead by building culture, not bullying. Seeking a salaried role where I can offer consistent results and high-level leadership.
